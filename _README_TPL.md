# Project Name # Don't Forget To

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
There are many things we're supposed to do but forget - check your smoke detector batteries every 6 months, clean the filter in your air conditioner every month, change your car's fluids, etc. Most of these things are meant to be done on a regular basis, but yet we all often forget them. My app will help you track these things you want to make sure you remember.


## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
We forget these things because they're not pressing and there are likely not visible consequences to not doing them in a timely manner.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
By having a chronological list of these events and when they should be done, it will be much easier to remember to do them!

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
For the user, they will just have to add the name of the thing they want to remember and the frequency (every month, year, etc.) and it will be added to their list of things to do!

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
Add your first thing now!
